"""Read-only access to Chrome's download directory — list what's there, fetch one file's bytes.

The directory is PINNED by policy (DownloadDirectory in shimpz-automation.json, see
rootfs-browser/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/shimpz-automation.json) to a known, fixed path — never
guessed from Chrome's own default resolution (which depends on $HOME and isn't worth depending on).
No shared volume with `shimpz-brain`: the brain fetches one file's bytes per call over the API, same
one-shot-per-call shape as screenshot_client.
